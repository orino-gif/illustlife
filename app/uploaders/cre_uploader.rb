  # process scale: [200, 300]

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  # version :thumb do
  #   process resize_to_fit: [50, 50]

  # Add an allowlist of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_allowlist
    %w(png jpg jpeg gif)
  end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
